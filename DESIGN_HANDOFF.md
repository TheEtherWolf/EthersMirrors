# EthersMirrors — Design Handoff

This file keeps Claude Code (CC) and Claude Design (CD) in sync.
Update it after every screen iteration.

## Workflow

1. **CC** describes what's needed → prompts **CD**
2. **CD** produces an HTML prototype bundle
3. **CC** fetches the bundle URL, extracts it, implements in Java (Minecraft Forge 1.20.1)
4. **CC** builds, deploys, commits, pushes
5. User tests in-game, feeds back to CD or CC

**Key constraints CC always enforces:**
- Pixel rendering only — `GuiGraphics.fill`, `drawString`, `drawCenteredString`
- No CSS/HTML in runtime — all animations via `System.currentTimeMillis()`
- Panel width locked at **460px** across all screens
- Shared chrome: `UITheme`, `MirrorButton` factory methods
- No AI attribution in commits, ever

## Screen Status

| # | Screen | CD Version | CC Status | Notes |
|---|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 01 | `MirrorSelectionScreen` | v2 | **Shipped** `190f01f` | v2 full rewrite |
| 02 | `MirrorCallScreen` | v2 | **Shipped** `431e69d` | Skin face + rune segments + green corner ticks |
| 03 | `PermissionScreen` | — | Not started | Next candidate |
| 04 | `MirrorManagementScreen` | — | Exists (legacy) | Needs CD pass |
| 05 | `PocketExpansionScreen` | — | Exists (legacy) | Needs CD pass |
| 06 | `MirrorNamingScreen` | — | Exists (legacy) | Needs CD pass |

## MirrorSelectionScreen v2 — What was built

**Panel:** 460×330px, 6 tabs (FAV / ALL / RECENT / NEARBY / CONTEXT / SEARCH)

**Key features:**
- Default tab = RECENT (falls back to ALL if empty)
- Selected row: dark green fill + inset border + 2px gold left tab
- Inspector strip (36px): shows mirror name, coords, tier on selection
- Sort chip: cycles Name / Signal / Dimension (3 modes)
- Per-tab empty states with unique glyphs + messages
- Scroll gutter with track + thumb, arrow buttons
- Context mode pills: TELEPORT / CALL / POCKET / WARP switch entire screen behavior
- Footer: PERMISSIONS (ghost) + CLOSE (gold)

**Column grid** (content=436px, 1fr=166px):
```
IDX=10  NAME=34  DIM=206  SIG=300  ACT=366  STAR=428
```

## MirrorCallScreen v2 — What was built

**Panel:** 460×172px, centered vertically (partial screen dim 0x88010008)

**States:**
- `INCOMING` — pulse rings on glyph box + 8-segment rune countdown
- `OUTGOING` — spinning dashed perimeter on glyph box + bouncing-dot ringing indicator
- `ACTIVE` — green corner ticks on glyph box + timer widget (elapsed + quality)

**Glyph box:** 64×64px, per-state tinted bg, player skin face 32×32 centred
- Face: `PlayerInfo.getSkinLocation()` blitted at 4× via pose scale; Steve fallback
- Incoming: 3 expanding square outline rings, 1600ms, offset by period/3
- Outgoing: 2 bright 14px dashes sweeping clockwise, 4000ms
- Active: green L-shaped 5px corner ticks (no rings)

**Rune segment countdown:** 8 arc segments, r=26, stroke 6px (r 23–28), 45° apart, 30.8° each
- Depletes from the end (ceil(8 × fraction) segments lit)
- Teal >50%, Gold 25–50%, Red ≤25%; last 2 segments pulse at 0.8s when red

**Keyboard:** ENTER answers INCOMING, ESC blocked during ACTIVE

**Data note:** `mirrorName`, `dimensionName`, `signalStrength` are nullable — packet
changes needed to populate them (future pass).

## What to tell CD next

When prompting CD for the next screen, include:

> "This is for a Minecraft mod GUI rendered in pure Java pixel ops (no CSS at runtime).
> Panel width is always 460px. Use the same header chrome as MirrorSelectionScreen:
> dark panel background, 32px header with mode pill left + title center + close right,
> teal/gold/purple/red accent palette, `MirrorButton` rounded pill buttons.
> Animate with time-based phases only (no CSS transitions). Output as a self-contained
> HTML prototype I can preview."

Then describe the specific screen.
